# PYTHON CONDITIONAL AND LOOPING STATEMENTS
# Python Conditional and Looping Statements Exercises
## INTRODUCTION
This repository contains Python exercises to help you understand and practice conditional statements and loops. These exercises cover a variety of scenarios that demonstrate how to use if-else conditions, for and while loops, and basic input/output operations in Python.
## EXERCISES
#### 1. Exercise 1: Month Names:
Write a program that reads an integer value (1-12) and prints the corresponding month name.

#### 2.Exercise 2: Cinema Ticket Pricing:Calculate ticket prices based on age.
#### 3.Exercise 3: Body Mass Index (BMI)
#### 4.Exercise 4: Greatest of Three Numbers
Write a program to determine the greatest of three numbers entered by the user.
#### 5.Exercise 5: Factorial Using Loops
Find the factorial of a number entered by the user using loops
#### 6.Exercise 6: Reverse a Number
Reverse a number entered by the user using a while loop.
#### 7.Exercise 7: Multiples of a Number
Write a program to find and print multiples of a number using a loop
#### 8.Exercise 8: Break Loop on Specific Input
Continuously print user input until the word done is entered, at which point the loop breaks.
#### 9.Exercise 9: FizzBuzz
Print numbers from 1 to 10, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz."
#### 10.Exercise 10: Number Pattern
## THEORY
### 1.Conditional Statements Theory
### i. If-Else Statements:
Conditional statements are used to execute specific blocks of code based on a condition. The most commonly used conditional statement in Python is if-else.
#### Syntax:
if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # Code to execute if the second condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if no condition is True
### ii.Nested If Statements:
Nested if statements are used when one if block contains another if block.
### 2.Looping Statements Theory
### i.For Loop:
A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, or range). It executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.
#### Syntax:
for variable in sequence:
    # Code to execute for each item
### ii.While Loop:
A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is True.
#### Syntax: 
while condition:
    # Code to execute while condition is True
## CONCLUSION
These exercises provide a practical way to learn and apply conditional statements and loops in Python.
